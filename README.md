Once you've opened the folder on your own PC, make sure to install the required dependencies using "npm install" in terminal once you're in the correct directory.

Create a .env file and add your API keys:
  VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY="your-key-here"

Finally, run "ionic serve" in the terminal to see the site in your browser.

To see the mobile app development requires the installation of xcode / simulator and android development toolkits.
